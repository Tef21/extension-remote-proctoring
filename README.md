Using this extension you can use the remote proctoring provider [Proctorio](https://proctorio.com) tool with TAO

## Installation instructions

These instructions assume that you have already a TAO installation on your system. If you don't, go to
[package/tao](https://github.com/oat-sa/package-tao) and follow the installation instructions.

If you installed your TAO instance through [package-tao](https://github.com/oat-sa/package-tao),
`oat-sa/extension-remote-proctoring` is very likely already installed. You can verify this under _Settings -> Extension
manager_, where it would appear on the left hand side as `RemoteProctoring`. Alternatively you would find it in
the code at `/config/generis/installation.conf.php`.

_Note, that you have to be logged in as System Administrator to do this._

Add the extension to your TAO composer and to the autoloader:
```bash
composer require oat-sa/extension-remote-proctoring
```

Install the extension on the CLI from the project root:

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo php tao/scripts/installExtension oat-sa/extension-remote-proctoring
```

**Windows:**
```bash
php tao\scripts\installExtension oat-sa/extension-remote-proctoring
```

As a system administrator you can also install it through the TAO Extension Manager:
